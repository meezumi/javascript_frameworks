what makes an API restfull? 
it uses standard http methods: get, post, put, patch, delete
it should have a std data format it responds with, json for say.
clients and servers are comppletly separate, hence independence.
statelessness - all the information is transferred from one side to the other.
rest api is resource based. (Universal Resource Locator)
an example can be internet.
